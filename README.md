# Database Management System 2022-2023
This project focuses on the design, development, and enhancement of a relational database management system for a fictional travel agency. It includes detailed schema design, stored procedures, triggers, and other database functionalities to manage various operations such as reservations, trip schedules, offers, and administrative tasks. The project was developed as part of the Database Management course at C.E.I.D, and it aims to mimic real-world database management scenarios.

## Features
- Relational Schema Design: Includes tables for workers, trips, branches, reservations, offers, and logs, with robust foreign key relationships.
- Stored Procedures: Automated operations such as driver allocation, date-based trip queries, and administrative checks.
- Triggers: Logs for inserts, updates, and deletions to ensure accountability and easy tracking of database changes.
- Custom Scenarios: Procedures to handle business-specific requirements like branch-specific driver allocation, trip seat availability, and reporting.
- Optimized Indexing: Enhanced query performance for critical operations such as reservation offer checks.
- Comprehensive Data: Simulated real-world data, including branches, employees, trips, and offers, to test the database's capabilities.

## GUI Application
A Java-based GUI has been implemented to interact with the database seamlessly. This graphical interface allows users to:

- View and manage reservations, trips, and offers.
- Query data and execute operations such as adding new workers or updating trip details.
- Access logs to monitor database changes in real-time.
- User-friendly approach to visualize and operate the database, making it accessible for administrators and end-users without SQL expertise.

## Tech Stack
